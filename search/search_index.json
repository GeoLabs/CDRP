In essence: The text highlights the critical need for improved interoperability between geospatial data systems used by different sectors to effectively respond to disasters. This requires addressing the semantic challenges arising from diverse data representations.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"D100/","title":"Climate and Disaster Resilience Pilot","text":"<p>Developed by-</p> <ul> <li>Gerald Fenoy - GeoLabs</li> <li>Chetan Mahajan - IIT Bombay</li> <li>Dr. Rajat Shinde - UAH</li> <li>Prof. Surya Durbha - IIT Bombay</li> </ul>"},{"location":"D100/datasets/","title":"Datasets","text":"<p>The virtual assistant leverages the following datasets:</p> <ul> <li>ECMWF Climate Data Store (CDS)</li> <li>Green Deal Data Space</li> <li>Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)</li> <li>WEkEO Environmental Data Hub</li> </ul>"},{"location":"D100/demo/","title":"Demo","text":""},{"location":"D100/future_directions/","title":"Future Directions","text":"<p>We plan to enhance the assistant by:</p> <ul> <li>Adding reasoning capabilities.</li> <li>Implementing visualization tools for scientific output.</li> <li>Extending support to more OGC standards.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"D100/methodology/","title":"Methodology","text":"<p>Steps to implement the project:</p> <ol> <li>Data curation and integration.</li> <li>Assistant development for NLP-enabled querying.</li> <li>Incorporation of Open Geospatial standards.</li> </ol> <p>The below figure summarises the workflow. </p>"},{"location":"D100/objectives/","title":"Objectives","text":"<p>Our project aims to:</p> <ul> <li>Build a Generative AI-enabled virtual assistant.</li> <li>Enhance data discoverability using NLP and structured APIs.</li> <li>Integrate workflows with OGC standards.</li> </ul>"}]}
